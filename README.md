## Main Task: Move Your Character

Build a simple project where:
- A character sprite moves around using arrow keys or WASD.
- Use CharacterBody2D, Sprite2D, and CollisionShape2D.
- Add a background or environment.

Feel free to make it funny, cute, or weird — it's your sandbox!

## Tasks

Each task builds on what you've learned and encourages creativity. You can do these in the same scene or create small new ones.

### 1. *Teleport Pads*
- Create two areas — when player enters one, teleport to the other.
- Use Area2D and signals.
