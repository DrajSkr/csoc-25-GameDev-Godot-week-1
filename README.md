## Main Task: Move Your Character

Build a simple project where:

- Use CharacterBody2D, Sprite2D, and CollisionShape2D.
- Add a background or environment.
- Feel free to make it funny, cute, or weird — it's your sandbox!

## Mini Assignments

Each of these can be added to your main task or done in a separate mini scene.

### 1. *Bouncy Ball Toy*
- Create a ball that moves and bounces inside a box.
- Add walls using StaticBody2D + CollisionShape2D.
- Bonus: Add gravity and make it bounce off the floor.

### 2. *Follow the Mouse*
- Make a sprite or object follow the mouse smoothly.
- Use Vector2.direction_to() or linear interpolation (lerp).
- Bonus: Rotate the sprite to face the cursor.

### 3. *Make a Simple Teleport Pad*
- Create two areas (Area2D with CollisionShapes).
- When the player enters one, teleport them to the other.
- Bonus: Add a teleport sound or visual flash.

### 4. *Sprite Switcher*
- Add multiple character sprites (or colors).
- Pressing a key (e.g. spacebar) swaps between them.
